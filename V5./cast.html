        <img class="content-area__img--jake" src="jake.png" alt="Jake Sully (Sam Worthington)">

        <h3 class="content-area__intro--jake">
            Sam Worthington reprises his role of disabled ex-marine turned forest-dwelling Na’vi <i>Jake Sully</i>, 
            only this time as a father of four — two sons and two daughters. Protecting his family defines 
            Jake now, as it does most fathers, but when the Sky People return to get revenge on their view of 
            an insurgent, Jake realizes he is also responsible for the forest nation that took him in, so he 
            makes some difficult decisions for their overall well-being and protection as well. Worthington is 
            known for roles like Marcus Wright in “Terminator: Salvation” (2009) Perseus in “Clash of the Titans,” 
            (2010) and James ‘Monster’ Murray in “Sabotage” (2014).

        <img class="content-area__img--2--neytiri" src="neytiri.png" alt="Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña)">

        <h3 class="content-area__intro--neytiri">
            <i>Neytiri</i> is the Na’vi love of Jake’s life. The story of their relationship can be found in the first “Avatar” film, 
            in which Neytiri fell in love with Jake despite him being an outsider. Neytiri feels torn between her people and her 
            love, but since she has started a new family, she ultimately devotes her energy to them and Jake. Zoe Saldaña has 
            appeared in many more sci-fi and fantasy franchises like the “Star Trek” films as Uhura and Marvel’s “Guardians of the 
            Galaxy” trilogy as Gamora. She plays Laura in “The Adam Project” (2022) as well as Irma St. Clair in “Amsterdam” (2022).

        <img class="content-area__img--kiri" src="kiri.png" alt="Kiri (Sigourney Weaver)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--kiri">
            <i>Kiri’s</i> conception inside the Avatar body of the late scientist and researcher Grace (Sigourney Weaver) remains a mystery, 
            but the young daughter of the lover of the Na’vi people carries on a lot of Grace’s characteristics, like her fascination 
            with the creatures of Pandora and how the whole system of the planet connects. Jake and Neytiri adopt Kiri, but the young 
            and gentle girl still feels out of place. She has the impressive ability to bond with any and all creatures, even the 
            plants and control them or get them to do their bidding. Sigourney Weaver played Dr. Grace Augustine, the most careful 
            and observative guest on Pandora, in the first “Avatar” film. Weaver is also known for roles like Ripley in “Alien” (1979) 
            and James Cameron's sequel "Aliens".

        <img class="content-area__img--2--quarritch" src="quaritch.png" alt="Quaritch (Stephen Lang)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--quarritch">
            Stephen Lang returns to Pandora in a reincarnation of sorts of his character from the first film: <i>Colonel Miles Quaritch.</i> 
            Though Jake killed Quaritch’s human form and body on Pandora in “Avatar” (2009), scientists had prepared for such an event 
            by storing his memories and essence on a backup hard drive to use for an Avatar body they inserted him into on Earth. 
            Quaritch returns to Pandora with a vengeance, targeting Jake Sully for thwarting the military efforts of conquering Pandora 
            in order to prepare it for humans since Earth’s survival is dwindling. Lang has also appeared in “Manhunter” as Freddy 
            Lounds, Ike Clanton in “Tombstone” and, more recently, The Blind Man in “Don’t Breathe” (2016).

        <img class="content-area__img--ronal" src="ronal.png" alt="Ronal (Kate Winslet)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--ronal">
            Kate Winslet plays <i>Ronal</i>, a free diver of the Metkayina people and the wife of Tonowari. This is Winslet’s first time 
            working with Cameron again after “Titanic,” and she’s also known for her performances in “Sense and Sensibility,” “Eternal 
            Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and “Steve Jobs.” She won an Oscar for “The Reader” and Emmys for her performances in “Mildred 
            Pierce” and “Mare of Easttown.”

        <img class="content-area__img--2--tonowari" src="tonowari.png" alt="Tonowari (Cliff Curtis)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--tonowari">
            Cliff Curtis plays <i>Tonowari</i>, King of the Reef People and loyal husband to Ronal. Tonowari becomes more accepting of Jake and his 
            family as time goes on. The two bond over fatherhood. Curtis is known for playing Smiley in ‘Training Day” (2001), Searle in “Sunshine” 
            (2007), Genesis in “The Dark Horse” (2014) and Yeshua in “Risen” (2016).

        <img class="content-area__img--neteyan" src="neteyan.png" alt="Neteyan (James Flatters)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--neteyan">
            <i>Neteyan,</i> first born son of Jake and Neytiri, often gets sucked into trouble by his younger and more daring brother Lo’ak 
            (Britain Dalton). His father puts a lot of pressure on him as the oldest son to lead by example and take care of his siblings.
            James Flatters appeared as Prince Tedros earlier this year in Netflix’s adaptation of “The School for Good and Evil” (2022) 
            based on the popular book series by Soman Chainani. He is also known for portraying William Sinclair in “The Forgotten Battle” 
            (2020).
        </h4>

        <img class="content-area__img--2--loak" src="loak.png" alt="Lo’ak (Britain Dalton)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--loak">
            <i>Lo’ak</i> embodies the classic mischievous younger brother whom Neteyan tries to shield from their ex-military father’s wrath. 
            Lo’ak often lives more on the edge, soaring into the carnage of battle and going hunting beyond the reef even though he has barely 
            mastered the technique of riding the underwater creatures. He bonds with tulkun outcast Payakan, who saves his life from a smaller 
            sharklike creature when the reef divers abandon him outside the contained borders of their aquatic community. Dalton has portrayed 
            Jason Larson in “Goliath” (2016). He has also appeared in “Ready Player One” as a High School Kid and voiced Young nathan in 
            “Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End.”

        <img class="content-area__img--tuk" src="tuk.png" alt="Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--tuk">
            <i>Tuk</i> is the youngest daughter of Jake and Neytiri. She always wants to accompany her brothers and sisters on adventures, 
            though she can be a bit cumbersome when the kids have to flee all kinds of threats. Previous roles of Bliss include Gabriella 
            in “Best Foot Forward” (2022) and Alexa Huh Garcia in “The Garcias” (2022).
        </h4>

        <img class="content-area__img--2--spider" src="spider.png" alt="Spider (Jack Champion)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--spider">
            <i>Spider</i> got left behind on Pandora when the marine forces trying to colonize it fled after Jake killed Colonel Quaritch, 
            Spider’s father. The curly haired baby grew up into a spry young man who ambles around the forest with Jake’s children, despite 
            the tension that he is not Na’vi. Spider and Kiri get along really well, and their bond suffers when the two get separated. Champion 
            has previously appeared in “Message in a Bottle” (2017), “The Night Sitter” (2018) and “Avengers: Endgame” as a kid on a bike.
        </h4>

        <img class="content-area__img--tsireya" src="tsireya.png" alt="Tsireya (Bailey Bass)">

        <h4 class="content-area__intro--tsireya">
            <i>Tsireya,</i> daughter of Ronal and Tonowari, helps Jake’s kids get their lay of the land (and ocean) when they first arrive 
            at the Reef People’s island. She and Lo’ak seem to have a thing for each other as well, with sparks flying the moment she emerges 
            from the water and Lo’ak lays eyes on her. Bailey Bass also plaed Claudia in the AMC series “Interview with the Vampire," and she 
            has also appeared on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”.
