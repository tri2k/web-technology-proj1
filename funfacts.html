                <h2 class = "container__card-title">1. The film's budget is a whopping amount.</h2>
                <p class = "container__text"> Director James Cameron has tried to keep the lid sealed on just how much Avatar: 
                    The Way of Water cost to produce, but he hasn't shied away from dropping in 
                    <a class = "container__link" href="https://www.gq.com/story/james-cameron-profile-men-of-the-year-2022">interviews</a> that it was, and I 
                    quote, “very f**cking expensive.” He's also expressed that the film possibly represented the worst business case 
                    in movie history, as in order to be profitable, it would have to be the third or fourth highest-grossing film in 
                    history just to break even. Sounds like a lot, doesn't it? Well, the latest sources have now hit Cameron's point home, as it was 
                    <a class = "container__link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/avatar-the-way-of-water-box-office-china-release-1235268699/">recently 
                    revealed</a> that the film could have cost a ginormous $350-$400 million. Yikes!</p>
            </article>


            <article class="container__card">
                <h2 class = "container__card-title">2. Everything the animated characters do on screen, the actors played out in real life.</h2>
                <p class = "container__text"> Sounds simple, I know, but hear me out. One of the key differences between Avatar: The Way of Water and some other 
                    films that use CGI characters is that all of the actors really did act out their scenes, and advanced motion 
                    capture technology meant that their eyes, facial expressions, emotions, and movements are preserved and translated 
                    into the CGI character. To compare, one example of a film that didn't do this was 
                    <a class = "container__link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/">Venom</a>, as Tom Hardy previously 
                    explained that motion capture wasn't used, leaving us to understand that Venom and all of his movements and 
                    expressions were brought to life by the digital animators (which is still amazing, by the way). I don't know 
                    about you, but I think that's one of the main reasons why Avatar: The Way of Water is able to convey so much 
                    emotion.</p>

            <article class="container__card">
                <h2 class = "container__card-title">3. And, the actors' skills were put to the test even more with Cameron opting for wet-for-wet photography.</h2>
                <p class = "container__text"> Forget the floating rigs and green screens, James Cameron was set on shooting the (many) water sequences in actual 
                    water to make the scenes as real as possible. As visual effects supervisor, Richie Baneham, explained in an 
                    <a class = "container__link" href="https://www.polygon.com/23542793/avatar-way-of-water-actors-underwater-motion-capture-making-of">interview,</a> 
                    “If an actor is genuinely in water, there's a viscous resistance. It informs the actor's choices. … 
                    That's what makes it feel real.” When watching the film, you'll really notice and get a feel for the effort 
                    that has gone into the underwater moments, from the seamless riding of the Skimwing sea creature, to how the 
                    character's hands sway when interacting with the aquatic plants. Whilst the actors and stunt team may not 
                    really be in Pandora's ocean, you'll spot these magical moments that would have probably felt a little more 
                    stiff and unnatural if filmed on dry land…(don't mention Aquaman, don't mention Aquaman).</p>

            <article class="container__card">
                <h2 class = "container__card-title">4. You guessed it, the underwater tanks were specifically created for the film.</h2>
                <p class = "container__text"> <a class = "container__link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-12-16/avatar-2-way-of-water-cast-crew-underwater-scenes-explained">
                    Two massive tanks were engineered</a> at Manhattan Beach Studios to help bring Cameron's wet-for-wet plan to life. 
                    One of the tanks was used for training and intimate character moments, whilst the other beast of a tank 
                    (measuring 120 feet long, 60 feet wide, and 30 feet deep with a 250,000-gallon capacity, to be exact) was full of 
                    wave and current machines designed to enhance the action-packed sequences. Mind. Blown.</p>

            <article class="container__card">
                <h2 class = "container__card-title">5. Even the epic finale fight scene was acted out, UNDERWATER.</h2>
                <p class = "container__text"> Plot spoiler alert ahead. Toward the end of the film, there is a huge and seriously long-winded fight scene between 
                    Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Quaritch (<a class = "container__link" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002332/?ref_=tt_cl_i_4">Stephen Lang</a>). 
                    As the sequence played out, I was sucked into believing 
                    that there really were lives at stake! Then, I got home and watched some BTS footage, and now, I know why. … 
                    The sequence really was filmed underwater. As you can see in the underwater featurette video, the stunt doubles 
                    play out the fight in what I would say is a massively terrifying situation. Plus, when talking about acting the 
                    fight out with Lang, 
                    <a class = "container__link" href="https://www.indiewire.com/video/avatar-the-way-of-water-sigourney-weaver-sam-worthington-interview-1234797880/">
                    Worthington said </a> it did have its risks for a few reasons. First of all, when he grabs 
                    Lang in a chokehold, he said that the realism “that you're trying to get across means he could die,” and the 
                    communication element goes out of the window because you just can't talk. Luckily, for the cast, Worthington 
                    said that you just have to rely on the safety people and the director watching it on the screens, as well as 
                    relying on each other…</p>

            <article class="container__card">
                <h2 class = "container__card-title">6. The cast and crew logged over 200,000 free dive hours.</h2>
                <p class = "container__text"> Supervising master diver for Avatar: The Way of Water, John Garvin, 
                    <a class = "container__link" href="https://divernet.com/scuba-diving/avatar-2-how-to-risk-manage-200000-dives/">stated that</a> more than 200,000 
                    dives had gone into making what he thought was the “most complicated diving movie ever made.” In the interview, he 
                    expressed that this number includes the amount of free dives, which were also difficult to log because some of them 
                    ranged from 30 to 60 seconds, while others were consistently longer! Garvin explained that on a typical busy shoot 
                    day, you'd see 26 scuba divers and free divers in the water at once, going up and down like yo-yos. That's not 
                    forgetting about the grip and lighting department who were forever submerging to tweak something on the set.</p>
