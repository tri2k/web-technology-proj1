            Everything you could want out of a sequel and more. The protagonist has matured greatly and looks even cooler. A whole cast of new characters who are a joy to watch grow and learn. You get to see a whole other side of Pandora never explored before and the visuals (especially in IMAX-3D) are so immersive it truly feels like you are spending time on this fictional world. Even the villain has more added depth to him this time around making some of the relationships in this film super complex and interesting. All of the new lore is super enriching from the new species, to the new locations etc. And the range of emotions this film takes you through is truly inspirational. If you liked the original you will love the sequel.

                    It’s more than you can possibly imagine. A fantasy world so vivid and real it commands your full attention for 3h 12m. And when it’s done, you’ll still want to linger in this heightened state of make believe.

                    It would be missing the point to call the proceedings indulgent to the point of self-infatuation: Cameron has built a new world from the remixed bits of this one, and he seems determined that we should not simply visit Pandora, we should live in it.

                    If you’re already a fan of the first Avatar, you will welcome a return to the realm of Pandora. Those who were lukewarm or hostile to the original won’t find anything new enough to merit consideration.
