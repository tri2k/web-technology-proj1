Develop a static website about your favorite movie.

Use the Web-representation technologies and apply standards and best practices discussed during the lectures on HTML, CSS, Web accessibility, responsive design, SEO, good coding style, etc. The visual appeal of your design is highly welcomed, but no strict requirements are specified on this mater. Yet, try avoiding deliberately repulsive color combinations. Your website is expected to present meaningful information about the topic. The pages should be bigger than a paragraph, but smaller than, say, a book chapter.

Requirements: Your website must:
- have at least 5 pages with meaningful content
- use HTML5 semantic attributes for formatting the layout of your pages
- use images
- have links between pages, within pages, and to external page(s)
- have at least one table (not used for formatting a webpage layout)
- be optimized for search engines
- use consistent layout and color scheme
- use CSS for formatting, including at least:
    - several different styles for links
    - several different styles for text
    - styles for table elements
    - cascading styles through selector specificity
    - style inheritance
- define all formatting styles in a separate CSS file
- be compliant with the HTML5 rules of W3C Markup Validation Service and the CSS3 rules of W3C CSS Validation Service
- not use any of the deprecated HTML elements or attributes
- render correctly in the current versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers
